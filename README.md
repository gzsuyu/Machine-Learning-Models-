# Machine-Learning-Models-
Some machine learning models implemented w/o packages such as skit-learn.

1. Ridge Regression
2. Naive Bayes Classification
3. KNN
4. Logistic Regression (with two gradient methods: Newtonâ€™s Method, Steepest Ascent Algorithm)
5. Gaussian Process
6. Boosting
7. KMean
8. Matrix Factorization
9. Non-negative Matrix Factorization


And 5 datasets are used:
1. Car's MPG: miles per gallon (Ridge Regression, Gaussian Process)
datasource: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG
2. Spam/Non-spam email (Naive Bayes Classification, KNN, Logistic Regression) 
datasource: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase
3. Occupancy Detection (Boosting)
datasource: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+
4. Movie Rating (Matrix Factorization)
datasource: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ (small dataset)
5. New York Times (Non-negative Matrix Factorization)

To be continue...
